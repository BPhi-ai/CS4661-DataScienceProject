# CS 4661 Data Science Education Project
## Garrett Stewart, Brian Pham, Jesus Perez, Gerardo Ibarra, Anthony Tsui

# Introduction

- with exams, many students either pass or fail on the exams just like life itself
- For those who fail, they need to study more.
- And because of this, there needs to be a way to look at the amount of students who fail the test and see if they need training.

# Goal

- The goal for this project is to prepare many students for the SAT/ACT by testing them on each subject and see which ones fail or pass at the exams
- This is so we can know who to train so they can catch up with the other students and have a chance at passing the exams.

# Responsibilities 

- Garrett Stewart, Jesus Perez, Brian Pham: Focus on making

# Datasets

- Within our project, we have many datasets within our project

- outcome: The outcome of the exam; in 1 or 2
- userid: The user id of the student
- questionid: THe question id of the test


If you want to look more into the datasets as well as more information regarding the development of our project, feel free to view the report and the slides.
